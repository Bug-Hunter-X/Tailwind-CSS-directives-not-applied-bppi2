# Tailwind CSS directives not applied

This repository contains a bug report and solution for a problem encountered while using Tailwind CSS directives. The directives were not being applied correctly to the elements in the code. 

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when attempting to apply Tailwind CSS classes using the `@apply` directive. The directive seems to be ignored by the compiler, and the styles are not applied to the target element.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the `@apply` directive is used correctly. This might involve verifying the installation, configuration file, build process, and the usage of the directive itself.
